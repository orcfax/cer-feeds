# Custom feeds press release

## Purpose

A first attempt at visioning the custom-feed product. The "Press Release" is
meant to serve as a gut-check as to the viability of the product and the Orcfax
team's enthusiasm for developing it.

This process uses [Working Backwards][backwards] method.

## product name

-   Orcfax Custom Feeds
-   Data Customization
-   Custom oracle feeds
-   Custom Orcfax feeds

## Intended customer

An entity which requires data to be published on the cardano blockchain so that
it may be referenced by stakeholders, hereafter referred to as an _integrator_.

## The problem the product solves

Integrators that want oracle feeds, other than price data, on-chain must develop
infrastructure to support the process by which this data is sourced, validated,
and ultimately published on-chain.

While this is undesirable for several reasons, the primary concern is that the
development and maintenance of this specialized oracle infrastructure is outside
the scope and expertise of these entities, so an external service provider is
needed.

Orcfax is perfectly positioned to meet these needs through its
\[Orcfax Custom Feeds\], which provide a solution for integrators by making
available a process through which their on-chain data needs and specifications
are met.

## Benefits to the integrator

Integrators that leverage our \[Orcfax Custom Feeds\] service will dramatically
reduce complexity within their stack, mitigate business development costs, and
will benefit from positive stakeholder perception as they prove their commitment
to developing commercially mature, robust, and increasingly decentralized
solutions.

Orcfax has removed the friction from mainnet feed deployment by providing an
automated and streamlined process where integrators have full control of the
data pipeline.

Integrators have the ability to:

-   specify the data that they want published;
-   identify the desired sources to be used;
-   manage the logic used to validate data before publication;
-   optimize feed utility by establishing publication cadence;

Orcfax's unique value proposition within the oracle space is its commitment to
complete auditability of data processes and downstream accessibility of that
data, which is secured through decentralized archiving. All of this is made
possible through Orcfax's adherence to globally recognized record management
best practices, which can be a requirement for integrator's seeking
institutional stakeholders and commercial utility.

## Aspirations for the product

Cardano is poised to provide the global market with both commercial and consumer
service alternatives which benefit from increased transparency and
accountability; and while the ecosystem continues to push for the adoption of
market leaders in the oracle space such as Chainlink or Pyth, solutions that are
actively under development (and outside the IOG or CF umbrellas) have no cost
effective method by which their solutions can leverage external oracle data that
meets their specific use cases.

The \[Orcfax Custom Feeds\] solution meets projects where they are and enables
them to increase market reach by incorporating a data pipeline which follows
globally recognized record keeping best practices.

## Call to action

If you are developing the next generation of cardano-based services,
\[Orcfax Custom Feeds\] can provide the data to meet your customers' needs; the
process is simple, and the Orcfax team is always available to assist your team
in delivering world-class solutions.

## FAQ

### Integrator: can Orcfax help develop the custom feed?

Some integrator's know the data type that they need for their use case but may
not know where to source the data from or may need assistance prior to
deploying their custom feeds. While the \[Orcfax Custom Feeds\] solution has
been specifically designed to enable integrator's to launch data feeds on their
own, the Orcfax team can be contracted for services such as feed review all the
way to full feed development to ensure the custom feed meets your needs.

Please contact our team at custom-feeds@orcfax.io to set up a consultation.

### Integrator: how much does a custom feed cost?

The total cost of a feed will depend on a number of factors such as:

-   whether Orcfax has been contracted to develop the feed
-   whether identified data sources require a subscription
    -   whether that subscription is shared with any other registered feed
-   whether the validator network is required to operate additional software
-   the frequency of publication on-chain

Once a feed has been deployed, the registering integrator will be charged \[5\]
ada per publication on production networks.

Integrators who wish to deploy their custom feed to pre-production networks
must coordinate with the orcfax team at custom-feeds@orcfax.io and may be
subject to additional service fees dependant on publication cadence and
duration.

### Integrator: how will I pay for my custom feed?

Orcfax has partnered with [Subbit][subbit] to provide a decentralized
subscription service; this service can be used in conjunction with your custom
feed by leveraging the keys used to initiate your subscription when registering
your custom feed.

### Orcfax: who formats the Fact Statement?

It's possible that some integrators will be opinionated as to how their data
should be archived; in all other cases, whose responsibility is it to develop
data type specific schemas?

The Orcfax [value proposition][prop-1] requires that custom feeds benefit from
the same schema.org treatment.

[prop-1]: #benefits-to-the-customer

#### A compromise?

Is is possible to create a schema which would be flexible enough to accommodate
data across use cases? With no, or very few, value substitutions?

### Integrator: Must my feed's data be archived?

Every use case has different stakeholder and user expectations, and while it's
possible that it may not be necessary for your data to be archived we encourage
integrator's to consider the many benefits of ensuring the proper archival
protection of their solution's data.

If you have questions about Ortcfax's record keeping processes, or need guidance
on how best to structure archival records, please reach out to info@orcfax.io

### Integrator: can my feed be published to other chains?

Yes! While Orcfax currently operates on Cardano and Arweave, our oracle solution
has been developed modularly so that operation on other chains can be explored
as use cases require. Note that publication to other chains may require the
Orcfax validator network to operate additional software; if this sounds like
your use case please contact our team to set up a consultation.
